- Keep public service/package definitions in `src/lib/catalog.ts` and share them across pages and enquiry forms, so prices and labels stay aligned.
- Store public visitor enquiries through validated server functions into RLS-locked `service_enquiries`; public clients must never access this private contact data directly.
- Keep the three requested content pages at `/`, `/about`, and `/contact`, with shared navigation in the root shell for consistent links and metadata.
